                                 BOMBARDMENT
               CREATIVE COMPUTING  MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY



YOU ARE ON A BATTLEFIELD WITH 4 PLATOONS AND YOU
HAVE 25 OUTPOSTS AVAILABLE WHERE THEY MAY BE PLACED.
YOU CAN ONLY PLACE ONE PLATOON AT ANY ONE OUTPOST.
THE COMPUTER DOES THE SAME WITH ITS FOUR PLATOONS.

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO FIRE MISSLES AT THE
OUTPOSTS OF THE COMPUTER.  IT WILL DO THE SAME TO YOU.
THE ONE WHO DESTROYS ALL FOUR OF THE ENEMY'S PLATOONS
FIRST IS THE WINNER.

GOOD LUCK... AND TELL US WHERE YOU WANT THE BODIES SENT!

TEAR OFF MATRIX AND USE IT TO CHECK OFF THE NUMBERS.
