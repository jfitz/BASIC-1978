DO YOU WANT INSTRUCTIONS? YES
WE ARE GOING TO PLAY A GAME BASED ON ONE OF THE CHESS
MOVES.  OUR QUEEN WILL BE ABLE TO MOVE ONLY TO THE LEFT,
DOWN, OR DIAGONALLY DOWN AND TO THE LEFT.

THE OBJECT OF THE GAME IS TO PLACE THE QUEEN IN THE LOWER
LEFT HAND SQUARE BY ALTERNATING MOVES BETWEEN YOU AND THE
COMPUTER.  THE FIRST ONE TO PLACE THE QUEEN THERE WINS.

YOU GO FIRST AND PLACE THE QUEEN IN ANY ONE OF THE SQUARES
ON THE TOP ROW OR RIGHT HAND COLUMN.
THAT WILL BE YOUR FIRST MOVE.
WE ALTERNATE MOVES.
YOU MAY FORFEIT BY TYPING '0' AS YOUR MOVE.
BE SURE TO PRESS THE RETURN KEY AFTER EACH RESPONSE.
