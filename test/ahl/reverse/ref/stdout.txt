REVERSE -- A GAME OF SKILL

DO YOU WANT THE RULES? YES

THIS IS THE GAME OF 'REVERSE'.  TO WIN, ALL YOU HAVE
TO DO IS ARRANGE A LIST OF NUMBERS (1 THROUGH 9 )
IN NUMERICAL ORDER FROM LEFT TO RIGHT.  TO MOVE, YOU
TELL ME HOW MANY NUMBERS (COUNTING FROM THE LEFT) TO
REVERSE.  FOR EXAMPLE, IF THE CURRENT LIST IS:

2 3 4 5 1 6 7 8 9

AND YOU REVERSE 4, THE RESULT WILL BE:

5 4 3 2 1 6 7 8 9

NOW IF YOU REVERSE 5, YOU WIN!

1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

NO DOUBT YOU WILL LIKE THIS GAME, BUT
IF YOU WANT TO QUIT, REVERSE 0 (ZERO).
