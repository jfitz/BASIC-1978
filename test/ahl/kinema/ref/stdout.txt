A BALL IS THROWN UPWARDS AT 19 METERS PER SECOND.

HOW HIGH WILL IT GO (IN METERS)? 4
NOT EVEN CLOSE....
CORRECT ANSWER IS  18.05

HOW LONG UNTIL IT RETURNS (IN SECONDS)? 4
CLOSE ENOUGH.
CORRECT ANSWER IS  3.8

WHAT WILL ITS VELOCITY BE AFTER 3.7 SECONDS? -19
CLOSE ENOUGH.
CORRECT ANSWER IS -18


 2 RIGHT OUT OF 3.  NOT BAD.


A BALL IS THROWN UPWARDS AT 5 METERS PER SECOND.

HOW HIGH WILL IT GO (IN METERS)? STOP
