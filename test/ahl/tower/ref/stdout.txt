                                 TOWERS
               CREATIVE COMPUTING  MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY




TOWERS OF HANOI PUZZLE.

YOU MUST TRANSFER THE DISKS FROM THE LEFT TO THE RIGHT
TOWER, ONE AT A TIME, NEVER PUTTING A LARGER DISK ON A
SMALLER DISK.

HOW MANY DISKS DO YOU WANT TO MOVE (7 IS MAX)4

IN THIS PROGRAM, WE SHALL REFER TO DISKS BY NUMERICAL CODE.
3 WILL REPRESENT THE SMALLEST DISK, 5 THE NEXT SIZE,
7 THE NEXT, AND SO ON, UP TO 15.  IF YOU DO THE PUZZLE WITH
2 DISKS, THEIR CODE NAMES WOULD BE 13 AND 15.  WITH 3 DISKS
THE CODE NAMES WOULD BE 11, 13 AND 15, ETC.  THE NEEDLES
ARE NUMBERED FROM LEFT TO RIGHT, 1 TO 3.  WE WILL
START WITH THE DISKS ON NEEDLE 1, AND ATTEMPT TO MOVE THEM
TO NEEDLE 3.

GOOD LUCK!
