               CREATIVE COMPUTING  MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY



SOMEWHERE ABOVE YOUR PLANET IS A ROMULAN SHIP.

THE SHIP IS IN A CONSTANT POLAR ORBIT.  ITS
DISTANCE FROM THE CENTER OF YOUR PLANET IS FROM
10,000 TO 30,000 MILES AND AT ITS PRESENT VELOCITY CAN
CIRCLE YOUR PLANET ONCE EVERY 12 TO 36 HOURS.

UNFORTUNATELY, THEY ARE USING A CLOAKING DEVICE SO
YOU ARE UNABLE TO SEE THEM, BUT WITH A SPECIAL
INSTRUMENT YOU CAN TELL HOW NEAR THEIR SHIP YOUR
PHOTON BOMB EXPLODED.  YOU HAVE SEVEN HOURS UNTIL THEY
HAVE BUILT UP SUFFICIENT POWER IN ORDER TO ESCAPE
YOUR PLANET'S GRAVITY.

YOUR PLANET HAS ENOUGH POWER TO FIRE ONE BOMB AN HOUR.

AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH HOUR YOU WILL BE ASKED TO GIVE AN
ANGLE (BETWEEN 0 AND 360) AND A DISTANCE IN UNITS OF
100 MILES (BETWEEN 100 AND 300), AFTER WHICH YOUR BOMB'S
DISTANCE FROM THE ENEMY SHIP WILL BE GIVEN.

AN EXPLOSION WITHIN 5,000 MILES OF THE ROMULAN SHIP
WILL DESTROY IT.

BELOW IS A DIAGRAM TO HELP YOU VISUALIZE YOUR PLIGHT.

X - YOUR PLANET
O - THE ORBIT OF THE ROMULAN SHIP

ON THE ABOVE DIAGRAM, THE ROMULAN SHIP IS CIRCLING
COUNTERCLOCKWISE AROUND YOUR PLANET.  DON'T FORGET THAT
WITHOUT SUFFICIENT POWER THE ROMULAN SHIP'S ALTITUDE
AND ORBITAL RATE WILL REMAIN CONSTANT.

GOOD LUCK.  THE FEDERATION IS COUNTING ON YOU.
