THIS IS A NUMBER GUESSING GAME. I'LL THINK
OF A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND ANY LIMIT YOU WANT.
THEN YOU HAVE TO GUESS WHAT IT IS.

WHAT LIMIT DO YOU WANT? 100

I'M THINKING OF A NUMBER BETWEEN 1 AND 100
NOW YOU TRY TO GUESS WHAT IT IS.
? 50
TOO HIGH. TRY A SMALLER ANSWER.
? 25
TOO LOW. TRY A BIGGER ANSWER.
? 37
TOO LOW. TRY A BIGGER ANSWER.
? 42
THAT'S IT! YOU GOT IT IN 4 TRIES.
VERY GOOD.
