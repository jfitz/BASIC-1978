DO YOU WANT TO SEE THE INSTRUCTIONS? (YES--1,NO--0)

THIS IS A GAME IN WHICH YOU WILL BE PLAYING AGAINST THE
RANDOM DECISION OF THE COMPUTER. THE FIELD OF PLAY IS A
CUBE OF SIDE 3. ANY OF THE 27 LOCATIONS CAN BE DESIGNATED
BY INPUTING THREE NUMBERS SUCH AS 2,3,1. AT THE START,
YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY AT LOCATION 1,1,1. THE OBJECT OF
THE GAME IS TO GET TO LOCATION 3,3,3. ONE MINOR DETAIL:
THE COMPUTER WILL PICK, AT RANDOM, 5 LOCATIONS AT WHICH
IT WILL PLANT LAND MINES. IF YOU HIT ONE OF THESE LOCATIONS
YOU LOSE. ONE OTHER DETAIL: YOU MAY MOVE ONLY ONE SPACE 
IN ONE DIRECTION EACH MOVE. FOR  EXAMPLE: FROM 1,1,2 YOU
MAY MOVE TO 2,1,2 OR 1,1,3. YOU MAY NOT CHANGE
TWO OF THE NUMBERS ON THE SAME MOVE. IF YOU MAKE AN ILLEGAL
MOVE, YOU LOSE AND THE COMPUTER TAKES THE MONEY YOU MAY
HAVE BET ON THAT ROUND.


ALL YES OR NO QUESTIONS WILL BE ANSWERED BY A 1 FOR YES
OR A 0 (ZERO) FOR NO.

WHEN STATING THE AMOUNT OF A WAGER, PRINT ONLY THE NUMBER
OF DOLLARS (EXAMPLE: 250)  YOU ARE AUTOMATICALLY STARTED WITH
500 DOLLARS IN YOUR ACCOUNT.

GOOD LUCK!
