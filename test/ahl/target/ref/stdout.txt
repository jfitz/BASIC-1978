               CREATIVE COMPUTING  MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY



YOU ARE THE WEAPONS OFFICER ON THE STARSHIP ENTERPRISE
AND THIS IS A TEST TO SEE HOW ACCURATE A SHOT YOU
ARE IN A THREE-DIMENSIONAL RANGE.  YOU WILL BE TOLD
THE RADIAN OFFSET FOR THE X AND Z AXES, THE LOCATION
OF THE TARGET IN THREE DIMENSIONAL RECTANGULAR COORDINATES,
THE APPROXIMATE NUMBER OF DEGREES FROM THE X AND Z
AXES, AND THE APPROXIMATE DISTANCE TO THE TARGET.
YOU WILL THEN PROCEEED TO SHOOT AT THE TARGET UNTIL IT IS
DESTROYED!

GOOD LUCK!!


RADIANS FROM X AXIS = 2.62022    FROM Z AXIS = 4.52593
TARGET SIGHTED: APPROXIMATE COORDINATES:  X= 10.0036   Y=-5.74586   Z=-2.17635
     ESTIMATED DISTANCE: 10

INPUT ANGLE DEVIATION FROM X, DEVIATION FROM Z, DISTANCE? 10,10,1

YOU BLEW YOURSELF UP!!
