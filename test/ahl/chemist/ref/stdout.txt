THE FICTITIOUS CHECMICAL KRYPTOCYANIC ACID CAN ONLY BE
DILUTED BY THE RATIO OF 7 PARTS WATER TO 3 PARTS ACID.
IF ANY OTHER RATIO IS ATTEMPTED, THE ACID BECOMES UNSTABLE
AND SOON EXPLODES.  GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF ACID, YOU MUST
DECIDE WHO MUCH WATER TO ADD FOR DILUTION.  IF YOU MISS
YOU FACE THE CONSEQUENCES.
 20 LITERS OF KRYPTOCYANIC ACID.  HOW MUCH WATER? 44
 SIZZLE!  YOU HAVE JUST BEEN DESALINATED INTO A BLOB
 OF QUIVERING PROTOPLASM!
 HOWEVER, YOU MAY TRY AGAIN WITH ANOTHER LIFE.
 36 LITERS OF KRYPTOCYANIC ACID.  HOW MUCH WATER? 84
 GOOD JOB! YOU MAY BREATHE NOW, BUT DON'T INHALE THE FUMES!
