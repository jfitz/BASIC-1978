                                 HURKLE
               CREATIVE COMPUTING  MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY




A HURKLE IS HIDING ON A 10 BY 10 GRID. HOMEBASE
ON THE GRID IS POINT 0,0 IN THE SOUTHWEST CORNER,
AND ANY POINT ON THE GRID IS DESIGNATED BY A
PAIR OF WHOLE NUMBERS SEPARATED BY A COMMA. THE FIRST
NUMBER IS THE HORIZONTAL POSITION AND THE SECOND NUMBER
IS THE VERTICAL POSITION. YOU MUST TRY TO
GUESS THE HURKLE'S GRIDPOINT. YOU GET 5 TRIES.
AFTER EACH TRY, I WILL TELL YOU THE APPROXIMATE
DIRECTION TO GO TO LOOK FOR THE HURKLE.

GUESS # 1 ? 3,3
GO NORTHEAST

GUESS # 2 ? 2,5
GO NORTHEAST

GUESS # 3 ? 1,7
GO EAST

GUESS # 4 ? 0,7
GO EAST

GUESS # 5 ? 3,7
GO EAST


SORRY, THAT'S 5 GUESSES.
THE HURKLE IS AT  4 , 7

LET'S PLAY AGAIN, HURKLE IS HIDING.
