                                 CHOMP
               CREATIVE COMPUTING  MORRISTOWN, NEW JERSEY




THIS IS THE GAME OF CHOMP (SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN, JAN 1973)
DO YOU WANT THE RULES (1=YES, 0=NO!)? 1
CHOMP IS FOR 1 OR MORE PLAYERS (HUMANS ONLY).

HERE'S HOW A BOARD LOOKS (THIS ONE IS 5 BY 7):

       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
 1     P * * * * * * 
 2     * * * * * * * 
 3     * * * * * * * 
 4     * * * * * * * 
 5     * * * * * * * 


THE BOARD IS A BIG COOKIE - R ROWS HIGH AND C COLUMNS
WIDE. YOU INPUT R AND C AT THE START. IN THE UPPER LEFT
CORNER OF THE COOKIE IS A POISON SQUARE (P). THE ONE WHO
CHOMPS THE POISON SQUARE LOSES. TO TAKE A CHOMP, TYPE THE
ROW AND COLUMN OF ONE OF THE SQUARES ON THE COOKIE.
ALL OF THE SQUARES BELOW AND TO THE RIGHT OF THAT SQUARE
(INCLUDING THAT SQUARE, TOO) DISAPPEAR -- CHOMP!!
NO FAIR CHOMPING SQUARES THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN CHOMPED,
OR THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE ORIGINAL DIMENSIONS OF THE COOKIE.
