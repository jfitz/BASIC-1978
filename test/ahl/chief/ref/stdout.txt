I AM CHIEF NUMBERS FREEK, THE GREAT INDIAN MATH GOD.
ARE YOU READY TO TAKE THE TEST YOU CALLED ME OUT FOR? NO
SHUT UP, PALE FACE WITH WISE TONGUE.
 TAKE A NUMBER AND ADD 3. DIVIDE THIS NUMBER BY 5 AND
MULTIPLY BY 8. DIVIDE BY 5 AND ADD THE SAME. SUBTRACT 1.

THIS TIMES 8 EQUALS 24. IF WE DIVIDE BY 5 AND ADD 5,
WE GET 9.8, WHICH, MINUS 1, EQUALS 8.8.
