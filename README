BASIC-1978

This is an interpreter for a BASIC interpreter. Created in 1964 by Kemeny and Kurtz, BASIC was an interactive language that could take advantage of timesharing systems.

This version is a form of BASIC that was popular in the 1970s.

Features of the language:
- Numeric variables, integer variables, and string variables
- Scalar variables, array variables, and matrix variables
- Functions ABS, EXP, FRAC, INT, LOG, MOD, RND, SGN, SQR, TIME
- Trigonometric functions ARCCOS, ARCSIN, ARCTAN, ATN, COS, COT, CSC, SEC, SIN, TAN
- Matrix functions CON, DET, IDN, INV, TRN, ZER
- String functions ASC, CHR$, INSTR, LEFT$, LEN, MID$, PACK$, RIGHT$, SPC$(), TAB, UNPACK, VAL$
- Single-line and multi-line user-defined functions in form FNx(X)
- Statements CHAIN, CHANGE, CLOSE, DATA, DEF FN, DIM, END, FNEND, FOR, FORGET, GOSUB, GOTO, IF, INPUT, LET, LINE INPUT, NEXT, ON-GOSUB, ON-GOTO, OPEN, OPTION PRINT, PRINT USING, RANDOMIZE, READ, REMARK, RESTORE, RETURN, STOP, WRITE
- Assignment statements may omit the LET keyword
- Statement keywords may be abbreviated to the first three characters.
- Statement modifiers IF, UNLESS, FOR, WHILE, and UNTIL at the end of statements
- Matrix operations MAT (assignment), MAT READ, MAT PRINT, MAT WRITE
- Array operations ARR (assignment), ARR READ, ARR PRINT, ARR WRITE
- Multiple statements on one line, separated by ':'
- Comments with single quote (') character
- File operations
- IF/THEN, with either a target line number or a target statement
- IF/THEN/ELSE, with target line numbers or target statements after the THEN and the ELSE
- Error handling with ON ERROR GOTO and RESUME
- FORGET statement to remove variables from memory

Features of the interpreter:
- Interactive mode and command-line mode
- Option for slow output to simulate Teletype speed
- Trace ability to print lines as they are executed
- Provenance for trace to indicate the lines in which variables were assigned
- Profile information with execution time and counts for each line
- Cross-reference listing
- Rudimentary debugger
- Rudimentary checks for infinite loop
- McCabe and Halstead complexity measurements
- Options for numeric precision
- Option to forget variable after FOR/NEXT loop
- Option to lock variable during FOR/NEXT loop
